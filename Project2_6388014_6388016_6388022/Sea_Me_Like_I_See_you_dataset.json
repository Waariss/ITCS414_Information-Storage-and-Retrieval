They are only known to only inhabit shallow water in restricted ranges around the islands west of Halmehera, Indonesia. Bamboo sharks forage for crustaceans and smaller fish using their unique walking abilities."}

They differ regionally by size and color, and tend to be more heavily spotted in the eastern Pacific than in the Hawaiian Islands where they have virtually no spots. The spotted dolphins of Japan and the eastern Indian ocean are moderately spotted. Spotted dolphins have a long slim beak with 35-48 small conical teeth in each side of the upper jaw and 34-47 small conical teeth in each side of the lower jaw. The spots begin to appear at the onset of weaning as dark blotches on the ventral surface. Closer to puberty, the spots increase in number and size and pale spots on the dorsal side begin to appear. Spotting varies among these species. Those with very dense light spots can appear white from a distance."}
