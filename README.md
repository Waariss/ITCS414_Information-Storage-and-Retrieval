# ITCS414_Information-Storage-and-Retrieval

## Overview
In the context of this course, I embarked on a journey to understand and implement efficient information storage and retrieval mechanisms. The course culminated in a project that underscored the importance of data integration, user requirement analysis, and effective search mechanisms, especially when tailored to specific domains.

## Assignments & Projects

### [Project: "Sea me like I see you"](https://github.com/Waariss/ITCS414_Information-Storage-and-Retrieval/tree/main/Project2_6388014_6388016_6388022)
In this endeavor, I delved deep into understanding the requirements of users and the target audience for a web search engine focused on marine life. By leveraging datasets and innovative data integration techniques, I harnessed the power of Elasticsearch to fetch pertinent information, ensuring users enjoyed a fluid search experience. This project was a testament to my ability to:
- Analyze and understand user requirements.
- Efficiently integrate data from various sources.
- Implement and customize Elasticsearch for domain-specific requirements.

The outcome was a search engine adept at retrieving marine life-related data, reflecting my enhanced skills in requirements analysis, data integration, and Elasticsearch. It stands as an example of my capacity to design and develop effective search solutions tailored to specific domains.
